# Nexus Voyagers

### Smart contract

This smart contract was built using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). You can refer to their [documentation](https://hardhat.org/docs) for more details.

### Unit tests

Unit tests are defined in the `test` subdirectory and can be executed locally by running:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

We also have a GitHub Action (defined in `.github/workflows/hardhat.yml`) that automatically runs the tests when a PR is issued against the `main` branch.
